> _Legacy Module Example: Logical Record Locking (Delphi)_

---

## Overview

This repository includes an example of a **core module** from a large-scale **legacy enterprise application**, fully implemented in **Delphi**.  
Designed and developed entirely by me, this module addresses a **critical challenge** in enterprise systems:  
> **Ensuring data integrity and controlling concurrent access in a multi-user environment.**

---

## ðŸ§© The Problem  

In enterprise applications, it's common for multiple users to view and modify shared data.  
Without proper safeguards, this leads to:

- **Data corruption**
- **Lost updates**
- **Inconsistent states**

A **robust logical record locking mechanism** is essential to **serialize access** and ensure consistent, safe operations.

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Solution

This component implements a **strict logical locking system**, with an emphasis on **data integrity** and **explicit control**.

### Key Features:

- **Explicit Lock Acquisition and Release**  
  Users or processes must **explicitly acquire** a lock before editing, and **explicitly release** it after.

- **Strict Lock Takeover Prevention**  
  `AllowLockTakeover := False` ensures that no lock can be overridden.  
  This protects users from losing work due to forced lock reassignment.

- **Concurrency Control**  
  Only one user can hold a write lock on a record at any time.

- **Modular Processor Design**  
  Implemented as `TDataProcessor` derivatives:  
  - `TProcAcquireReleaseLock`  
  - `TProcOptimizeLockTable`  
  Clean integration and well-defined I/O interfaces.

- **Efficient Lock Management**  
  Includes `OptimizeLockTable` procedure to clean up stale or orphaned locks and maintain DB efficiency.

## ðŸ§  Why This Module Matters

Although written in Delphi, this module demonstrates my ability to tackle **foundational software engineering problems**, including:

- **Concurrency & Resource Management**  
  Solving real-world problems in complex, multi-user systems.

- **System Architecture & Design**  
  This is not just implementation â€” it's full **design** of a critical infrastructure component.

- **Enterprise-Grade Engineering**  
  Designed for **mission-critical**, high-reliability systems.

- **Language Versatility**  
  Shows I can apply **engineering principles** effectively across platforms and languages.
