Legacy Module Example: Logical Record Locking (Delphi)  
This repository also includes an example of a core module from a large-scale legacy enterprise application, implemented in Delphi. This module, entirely designed and developed by me, addresses the critical challenge of ensuring data integrity and managing concurrent access in a multi-user environment.  

The Problem Solved  
In enterprise applications where multiple users can simultaneously view and modify the same data records, preventing concurrent modifications (e.g., two users editing the same record at once, leading to data corruption or lost updates) is paramount. This module provides a robust logical record locking mechanism to serialize access to specific records.  

My Solution & Key Design Principles  
As the sole designer and developer of this component, I implemented:  

Explicit Lock Acquisition and Release: Users or processes must explicitly acquire a lock on a record before modification and release it afterwards.  
Strict Lock Takeover Prevention: A core design principle was to forbid lock takeover (AllowLockTakeover := False). This critical decision ensures strict data integrity, preventing one user from forcibly taking a lock from another, thereby protecting ongoing work and ensuring data consistency.  
Concurrency Control: The mechanism ensures that only one user can hold a write lock on a specific record at any given time, effectively managing concurrent access.  
Modular Processor Design: Implemented as TDataProcessor derivatives (TProcAcquireReleaseLock, TProcOptimizeLockTable), allowing for clean integration into the application's processing pipeline and clear definition of input/output interfaces.  
Efficient Lock Management: Includes an OptimizeLockTable procedure to maintain the health and efficiency of the underlying lock storage, removing stale or invalid locks.  
Why This Module Is Relevant  
While implemented in Delphi, this module showcases my ability to:  

Solve Fundamental Computer Science Problems: Concurrency control, data integrity, and resource management are universal challenges in software engineering.  
Design and Architect Solutions: This wasn't just coding; it was designing a critical piece of infrastructure from the ground up to meet complex business requirements.  
Develop Robust Enterprise-Grade Software: Demonstrates experience in building reliable systems for multi-user, mission-critical applications.  
Adapt to Diverse Technology Stacks: Highlights versatility and the capability to apply core engineering principles across different programming languages and environments.  
This component represents my comprehensive understanding of building resilient backend systems and my ability to deliver critical features from conception to implementation.
